Windows 7 apparently always prioritizes the wireless network connection (Wi-Fi) – no matter if a faster wired network connection is available. This is default behavior &#8211; go figure!

Luckily you can change it, but it isn’t easy to find. Do the following:

  1. Go to &#8220;Network and Sharing Center&#8221; (e.g. through the “Control Panel”)
  2. Click &#8220;Change Adapter Settings&#8221;
  3. In the &#8220;Network Connections&#8221; window, press the ALT key on your keyboard to being up the menu bar.

  4. Click the &#8220;Advanced&#8221; menu and then &#8220;Advanced Settings&#8221;
  5. In the “Advanced Settings” windows on the &#8220;Adapters and Bindings&#8221; tab under &#8220;Connections&#8221;, you can change the network connection priority with the arrows on the right.

It will still connect to all available network connections (wireless and wired), unless they are disabled.
