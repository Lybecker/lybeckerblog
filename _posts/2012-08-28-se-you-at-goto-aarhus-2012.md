Are you going to [GOTO Aarhus 2012](http://gotocon.com/aarhus-2012/ "GOTO Aarhus 2012 conference homepage") conference October 1-3 in Aarhus, Denmark?

The conference is covers diverse software development topics like big data, augmented data, agile perspectives, JavaScript, UX, continuous delivery, mobile, cloud, languages, NoSQL, scale … so this is not a vendor specific conference where the newest technology is presented.

I prefer conferences where I get inspired… a conference where all the participants; speakers and fellow participants plant seeds in my head for new ideas and alternative approaches to solving problems.

That’s why I’m going to the GOTO Aarhus conference.
