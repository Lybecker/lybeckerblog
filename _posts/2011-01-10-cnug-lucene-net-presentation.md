I have just held another presentation about Lucene.Net, this time in [Copenhagen .Net user group](http://cnug.dk/ "Copenhagen .NET User Group homepage"). I hope everyone enjoyed the presentation and walked away with newfound knowledge how to implement full text search into their applications.

I love the presentations, like this one, where everyone participates in the discussion. It makes the experience so much enjoyable and everyone benefits of the collective knowledge sharing.

The presentation and code samples can be downloaded below:

* Presentation ([pdf](/wp-content/uploads/Apache-Lucene-CNUG.pdf))
* [Code samples (Visual Studio 2010)](/wp-content/uploads/CnugLucenePlayground.zip)

I recommend the book [Lucene in Action by Eric Hatcher](http://www.manning.com/hatcher3/). The samples in this book are all in Java, but they apply equally to Lucene.Net, as it is a 1:1 port of the Java implementation.
