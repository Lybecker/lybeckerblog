The next release of C# 6 has some amazing new features. In a series of blog posts I will cover some of them.

* Chained null checks (this one)
* [The nameof operator](/blog/2015/01/08/the-nameof-operator/ "The nameof operator blog post by Anders Lybecker")
* [Awesome string formatting](/blog/2015/01/09/awesome-string-formatting/ "Awesome string formatting blog post by Anders Lybecker")
* [Expression-bodied methods](/blog/2015/01/13/expression-bodied-methods/ "Expression-bodied methods blog post by Anders Lybecker")
* [Auto-property initializers](/blog/2015/01/15/auto-property-initializers/ "Auto-property initializers blog post by Anders Lybecker")
* [Initialize a Dictionary with index initializers](/blog/2015/01/19/initialize-a-dictionary-with-index-initializers/ "Initialize a Dictionary with index initializers blog post by Anders Lybecker")

Null-conditional operators is one of the features in C# 6 that will save the world from a lot of boilerplate code and a bunch of `NullReferenceExceptions`.Â It works as chained null checks!

```csharp
Console.WriteLine(person?.HomeAddress?.City ?? "City unknown");
```

Note the null-conditional operator (`?.`) after `person` and `HomeAddress`, it returns null and terminates the object reference chain, if one of the references are null.

**Note:** C# 8.0 adds [Nullable Reference Types](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/nullable-references) which can remove the the risk of `NullReferenceException`. You can enable the null reference analysis at project level
{: .notice--success}

It is the same logic as the below code that you can use today.

```csharp
if (person != null)
    person.HomeAddress != null)
{
  Console.WriteLine(person.HomeAddress.City);
}
else
{
  Console.WriteLine("City unknown");
}
```

The null-conditional operator will also make it easier to trigger events. Today it is required to reference the event, check if it is null before raising the event like so.

```csharp
protected void OnPropertyChanged(string name)
{
  PropertyChangedEventHandler handler = PropertyChanged;

  if (handler != null)
  {
    handler(this, new PropertyChangedEventArgs(name));
  }
}
```

But the null-conditional operator provides a tread-safe way of checking for null before triggering the event.

```csharp
PropertyChanged?.Invoke(this, args);
```
