The third and last day at the JAOO conference was the best in regards of the sessions I attended. My day session schedule looked like this:

  * &#8220;MonoRail: Building Maintainable and Testable Web Applications&#8221; by Oren Eini and Hamilton Verissimo
  * &#8220;Fault Tolerance&#8221; by Robert S. Hanmer
  * &#8220;Performance Art&#8221; by [Kevlin Henney](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevlin_Henney "Kevlin Henney at Wikipedia")
  * &#8220;Applying Craftsmanship&#8221; by [Pete McBreen](http://www.mcbreen.ab.ca/ "PEte McBreen's site")
  * Panel discussion: &#8220;Enterprise Application Frameworks&#8221; with [Graeme Rocher](http://graemerocher.blogspot.com/ " Graeme Rocher's Blog"), [Eberhard Wolff](http://jandiandme.blogspot.com/ "Eberhard Wolff's blog"), [Erik DÃ¶rnenburg](http://erik.doernenburg.com/ "Erik Doernenburg's blog"), Oren Eini, Justin Gehtland, and [Alef Arendsen](http://blog.arendsen.net/ "Alef Arendsen's blog")

I have written an abstract of the session &#8220;Applying Craftsmanship&#8221; by Pete McBreen in a separate blog post, because it deserved it. It made me think (which is a good thing ðŸ™‚ ). Read it [here](http://www.lybecker.com/blog/2007/09/26/jaoo-session-applying-craftsmanship-abstract/ "Session Abstract").

**JAOO 2007 conference summary**
I enjoyed the JAOO conference, but was a bit disappointed with the technical level. Again, maybe my expectations were too high? But then again, I will consider coming back next year. That has absolutely nothing to do with the fact that I won an Apple iPod at an IBM contest. ðŸ™‚

Below is a picture of the price I won in the IBM contest.
