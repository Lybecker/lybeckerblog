I am on my way to the [JAOO conference](http://www.jaoo.dk "JAOO conference 2007") in [Aarhus](http://www.aarhus.dk "Aarhus city information"), Denmark with a colleague. We booked a late train and ended up on a geek train!
Addicted as we are, we logged on the Internet via our mobil phones and noticed that we were not the only ones with Bluetooth enabled laptops/mobil phones!
This was what we say.

[![Bluetooth](http://www.lybecker.com/blog/wp-content/geektrain.jpg)](http://www.lybecker.com/blog/wp-content/geektrain.jpg "Bluetooth")

That is pretty amazing as Bluetooth is a personal network and the range is about 10 meters.
