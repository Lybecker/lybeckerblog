Running the below code will fail â€“ why?

<pre class="brush: csharp; title: ; notranslate" title="">var syncRoot = new object();

Monitor.Enter(syncRoot);

ThreadPool.QueueUserWorkItem(x =&gt; Monitor.Exit(syncRoot));

</pre>

It will throw a SynchronizationLockException with the message &#8220;Object synchronization method was called from an unsynchronized block of code.&#8221;

It is because System.Threading.Monitor requires the Enter and Exit methods must be executed on the same thread for the same synchronization object.

I did not know that :-/
