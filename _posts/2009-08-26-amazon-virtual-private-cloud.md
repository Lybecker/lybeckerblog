If you are interested in cloud computing, but you never known how to adopt this new paradigm in your shop due to ignorance ðŸ˜‰ I encourage you to look at the [Amazon EC2](http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/ "Amazon EC2 site") and [related services](http://aws.amazon.com/ "Amazon Web Services site").

One of the things that have kept me and properly many others from migrating our applications and services to the cloud has been due to the nature of most software requiring integration to legacy systems behind a company firewall.

Amazonâ€™s new service â€“ [Amazon Virtual Private Cloud](http://aws.amazon.com/vpc/ "Amazon Virtual Private Cloud site") enables you to extend the companyâ€™s network to Amazonâ€™s cloud via a secure VPN connection.

Read more about this new service from Amazon on Werner Vogels' article [Seamlessly Extending the Data Center &#8211; Introducing Amazon Virtual Private Cloud](http://www.allthingsdistributed.com/2009/08/amazon_virtual_private_cloud.html "Article: Seamlessly Extending the Data Center - Introducing Amazon Virtual Private Cloud").
