While writing and posting this post I&#8217;m currently flying from Copenhagen, Denmark to London, United Kingdom over the North Sea with [Norwegian](http://www.norwegian.com/ "The airline carrier Norwegians' homepage") airlines using the free online Wi-Fi connection onboard. The Internet connection is slow, but that&#8217;s expected as the traffic is routed through satellites and the fact that I share the connection with the 250 or so other passengers; all trying to access Facebook ðŸ™‚

A ping request to Google.com show that a roundtrip takes around 800 ms with some fluctuations into the 1200 ms

An Internet connection speed test reveals my upload was around 400 Kbit/s download and 15 Kbit/s upload.

A trace route didn&#8217;t disclose much information; therefore not included in this blog post.

The Internet connection is very unreliable making it impossible to work, but IM and light sites are browsable. Internet on a flight is a welcome initiative making it more pleasant to fly.

I just hope the competitors will do the same and the quality of the connection will improve.
