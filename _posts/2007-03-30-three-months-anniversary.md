My daughter is now three months old. Everything is going well &#8211; she is gaining weight, eating, smiling and making funny noises which I interpret as laughing. She is aware and eager to interact with her surroundings. She grabs after the diapers at the changing table pulling them out of the container one-by-one and has for more than a month been able to keep focus on
moving objects.

By the way, we are going to name her Victoria.
