I needed to compress a lot of files into individual zip archives â€“ I did not want to do it manually ðŸ™‚

Add the following to a bat file and every file with the extension txt will be compressed into a Zip archive with [7-Zip file archiver](http://www.7-zip.org/ "7-Zip's website"):

<pre class="brush: bash; title: ; notranslate" title="">@echo off
For %%f in (*.txt) do 7z.exe a -tzip %%f.zip %%f
</pre>

E.g. _a.txt_ will be compressed to the archive _a.txt.zip_

This was not exactly what I needed, as the dual extension caused problems in later processing. In needed to remove the extension preceding the zip extension â€“ therefore:

<pre class="brush: bash; title: ; notranslate" title="">@echo off
For %%f in (*.txt) do 7z.exe a -tzip %%~nf.zip %%f
</pre>

E.g. _a.txt_ will be compressed to the archive _a.zip_

Thatâ€™s it ðŸ™‚
