I am speaking at the launch of Windows Server 2008, Visual Studio 2008 and SQL Server 2008 in Denmark February 28th. It will be an online launch â€“ meaning that you can watch in comfort of your personal development sphere ðŸ˜€

As it is a Danish event and we Danes speak Danish â€“ the event will be in Danish ðŸ™‚

You can sign-up [here](http://www.microsoft.com/danmark/technet/detskerher/default.aspx "Microsoft Denmark launch event sign-up").
