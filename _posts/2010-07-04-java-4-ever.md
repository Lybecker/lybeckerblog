I find this video hilarious&#8230;  
  
You should use the best tools at hand to solve the problem. That said; choosing between Java or .Net doesnâ€™t really matter in most cases. There are however some areas where Java is a better choice and vice versa.

I canâ€™t wait to see it in the cinema ðŸ™‚

PS. I do develop with Java even though I do not blog much about it.

Update: YouTube removed the video due to copyright claims. You can still see it [JavaZone](http://jz10.java.no/java-4-ever-trailer.html).
