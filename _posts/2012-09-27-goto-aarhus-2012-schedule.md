Soon I&#8217;ll be joining a bunch of great people from the Danish developer community and abroad at this year [GOTO Conference in Aarhus](http://gotocon.com/aarhus-2012/ "GotoAar 2012 website") next week.

I&#8217;ve been looking at the [conference schedule](http://gotocon.com/aarhus-2012/schedule/ "GotoAar 2012 conference schedule") trying to create my schedule‚Ä¶ the line-up of international fame speakers are impressive, but I&#8217;ll go for the odd sessions to expand my horizon. During breaks I‚Äôll discuss and share ideas with my fellow attendees ‚Äì I might even skip sessions for interesting discussions in the hallways.

Here is my tentative schedule:

  * Monday I&#8217;ll attend ‚Äú[What is value?](http://gotocon.com/aarhus-2012/presentation/What%20is%20value?)‚Äù and ‚Äú[Management Myths: are we getting any better at this?](http://gotocon.com/aarhus-2012/presentation/Management%20Myths:%20are%20we%20getting%20any%20better%20at%20this?)‚Äù to expand my software engineering and project management skillset.
  * Tuesday I&#8217;ll look at the Biiiig Data tracks and attend &#8220;[Building secured, scalable, low-latency web applications with the Windows Azure Platform](http://gotocon.com/aarhus-2012/presentation/Building%20secured,%20scalable,%20low-latency%20web%20applications%20with%20the%20Windows%20Azure%20Platform)&#8221; and &#8220;[Runaway complexity in¬†Big Data systems&#8230; and a plan to stop it](http://gotocon.com/aarhus-2012/presentation/Runaway%20complexity%20in%20Big%20Data%20systems...%20and%20a%20plan%20to%20stop%20it)&#8220;. Hopefully I‚Äôll be inspired how to handle the 1TB size systems; I‚Äôm working on.
  * Wednesday I&#8217;ll attend the ‚Äú[Professional Productivity](http://gotocon.com/aarhus-2012/presentation/Professional%20Productivity%20-%20Part%201)‚Äù sessions ‚Äì yep‚Ä¶ I hope to become twice as productive üôÇ
