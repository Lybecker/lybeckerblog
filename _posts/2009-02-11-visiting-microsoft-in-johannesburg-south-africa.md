I live and work in the suburbs of Copenhagen in Denmark, but I’m currently in South Africa on business. While I’m here I might as well visit Microsoft South Africa – I did that today. I attended a presentation of the [.Net services](http://www.microsoft.com/azure/netservices.mspx) by Juval Löwy.

Microsoft South Africa is situated in a nice and fairly new building, as you can see on the picture above.

I was amazed about the level of security – first I had to cleared by the security guards before entering the parking lot. This is not uncommon in South Africa, but very uncommon in Denmark.

Inside in the reception the security check barriers prevent unauthorized people to enter.

When I finally was granted access to the presentation, Microsoft served sodas, pizza and beer!
