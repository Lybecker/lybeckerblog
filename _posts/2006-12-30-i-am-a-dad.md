At 01:10 (1:10 AM) Saturday the December 30th 2006 I became a father. It is a big thing for me, but still strange. Normally when I see a newly born baby and the parents claim it is the most beautiful baby in the world, I yarn. Most babies are ugly.

My baby girl is not the most beautiful baby, but a close runner up ðŸ˜‰
