Today I just witness the electronic annual general meeting for the investment company [SparIndex](http://www.sparindex.dk/ "SparIndex homepage"). This is the first 100% electronic annual general meeting ever.

The stakes was high, especially for the system owner [VP Securities](http://www.vp.dk/ "VP Securities homepage") as journalists and photographs wandered around the offices ready to report success or failure in the media.

My job as a technical consultant, together with a handful of other techies, was to monitor the solution during the live annual general meeting. Our job was to prevent any technical glitches or in the event of a crash recover as fast as possible.

The tension was high right up to the last minute before the premiere, but everything went smooth. ðŸ™‚
