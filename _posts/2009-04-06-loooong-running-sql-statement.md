![Long running command](/wp-content/uploads/sqlserverprofilerrenegate.jpg)

I was using SQL Server Profiler on a SQL Server 2005 Enterprise Edition looking for performance culprits, when I stumbled upon this very long running process.

I think this must be a world record. ðŸ™‚

This statement has only used 16 milliseconds of CPU but it has been running for more than 500.000 years!
