[![SQL Server 2008 - long overdue features for developers presentation](http://www.lybecker.com/blog/wp-content/sqlserver2008presentation.jpg)](http://www.microsoft.com/danmark/technet/detskerher/default_webcast.aspx?id=115 "SQL Server 2008 - Long overdue features for developers webcast")

All the presentations from the product launch are recorded as webcasts. They are available [here](http://www.microsoft.com/danmark/technet/detskerher/default.aspx "Microsoft LAUNCH det sker {her}") (itâ€™s in Danish). Later this year the webcast will be moved to TechNet.

I spoke about _long overdue features in SQL Server for developers_.

Some of the webcasts has poor sound quality (not mine ðŸ˜‰ ), which is a shame.

The webcasts where recorded at Microsoft. They used [Camtasia Studio](http://www.techsmith.com/camtasia.asp "Camtasio Studio site") which I highly recommend as it is easy, intuitive and have some great features.

I guess the poor sound quality is due to lack of proper microphones and the recording was done in a regular meeting room. They used the build-in microphone on my laptop. Microsoft Denmark should have better sound equipment and a recording studio if they are serious about webcasts.
