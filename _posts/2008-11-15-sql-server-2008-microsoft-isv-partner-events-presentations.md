This week I hosted two sessions at two different events for Microsoft Denmark. One at Radisson SAS Scandinavia Hotel in Århus and one in Microsoft Denmark’s headquarter in Hellerup.

It was fun at the feedback was very positive. The best part was during the breaks with great edifying technical discussions. All the slides are available at [Miracle&#8217;s homepage.](http://www.miracleas.dk/index.asp?page=168&page2=549)
