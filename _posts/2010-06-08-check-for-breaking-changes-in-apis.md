Have you ever had the need to compare interfaces of two versions of the same framework?

If you have, then [ApiChange](http://apichange.codeplex.com/ "ApiChange on CodePlex") is a tool for you. Itâ€™s open source, powerful and easy to use ðŸ™‚

I gave it a spin comparing current trunk version 2.9.2 of Lucene.Net with the latest official release version 2.4.0.

I downloaded ApiChange and ran the following command in a command prompt:

<pre class="brush: bash; title: ; notranslate" title="">ApiChange.exe -Diff -old C:Lucene.Net_2_4_0Lucene.Net.dll -new C:trunkLucene.Net.dll
</pre>

The output [lists all the differences](http://www.lybecker.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/BreakingChangesInLucene.txt), but here is a summary:

  * 23 public types where removed
  * 96 public types where added
  * 158 public types where changed

Cool little tool with other features such as:

  * Diff public types for breaking changes.
  * Who uses a method?
  * Who uses a type?
  * Who uses implements an interface?
  * Who references me?
  * What format has the binary (32/64, Managed C++, Pure IL, Unmanaged)?
  * Search for all event subscribers and unsubscribers.

Itâ€™s based on [Mono Cecil](http://www.mono-project.com/Cecil "Mono Cecil's website") â€“ a free IL parser, and not reflection as I initial thought. [Go check it outâ€¦](http://geekswithblogs.net/akraus1/archive/2010/06/03/140207.aspx "ApiChange author blog post ApiChange Is Released!")
