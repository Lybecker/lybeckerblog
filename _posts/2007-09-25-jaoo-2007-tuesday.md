The day at JAOO was better than yesterday, but still not great. Maybe my expectations are too high?
Todayâ€™s JAOO conference of the honorable mentionable:

  * &#8220;Painless Persistence with Castle ActiveRecord&#8221; by [Oren Eini](http://www.ayende.com/ "Ayende @ Rahien") and [Hamilton Verissimo](http://hammett.castleproject.org/ "Hamilton Verissimo's blog") &#8211; which was a tutorial of [Castle ActiveRecord](http://www.castleproject.org/activerecord/ "Castle ActiveRecord homepage"). The session was fairly good â€“ I learned some new stuff but knew most of it in advance. I like the idear of minimizing the complexity of data access logic, but I do not fancy the solution where the domain model objects are bound by attributes. I prefer the XML based solution found in for example [nHibernate](http://www.nhibernate.org/ "nHibernate homepage"). It is a lot more tedious work, but the solution benefits of separation of concerns.
  * &#8220;C# 3.0 under the hood&#8221; by Mads Torgersen â€“ this session was a good recap of something I read a while ago. I canâ€™t recall the source, sorry. The session wasnâ€™t as much under the hood as the title states, but still Mads delivered a compelling walkthrough of the construct of [LINQ](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/netframework/aa904594.aspx "The LINQ Project homepage") (Language Integrated Queries).
  * &#8220;Using LINQ to SQL to Access Relational Data&#8221; by [Luca Bolognese](http://blogs.msdn.com/lucabol/ " Luca Bolognese's blog") â€“ I was delighted to see that Microsoft has taken concepts from nHibernate and adopted them as their own. There are many similarities between nHibernate and [LINQ to SQL](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb425822.aspx "LINQ for for Relational Data in SQL Server"), but I need to dig further into the subject to see if I should make the switch from nHibernate to full blown LINQ, with all it entitles. Alternatively I could just use the LINQ for nHibernate when it is released in version 1 in 3-6 months.

My last day at JAOO is tomorrow. Let us see what tomorrow brings. ðŸ™‚
