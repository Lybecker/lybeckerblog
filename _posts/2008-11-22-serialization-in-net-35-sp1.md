In .Net 3.5 SP1 it is now possible to serialize any object that has a default constructor without decorating it with [DataContract] or [Serializable].

Developers have these choices now when serializing objects:

  * Implicit serialization â€“ requires public default constructor and only serialize public read/write fields
  * Use the [Serializable] attribute
  * Use [DataContract] and [DataMember] attributes
  * Implement the ISerializable interface

I must say, that Iâ€™m not keen on this new feature. I prefer explicit serialization to implicit serialization. I predict that implicit serialization of entire object graphs will cause performance problems for many .Net developers in the years to come. This could also be a good thing as I am a consultantÂ  ðŸ˜‰
