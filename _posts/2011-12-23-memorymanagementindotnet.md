[](http://www.red-gate.com/products/dotnet-development/ants-memory-profiler/learning-memory-management/resources/GCPoster.pdf)Iâ€™ve written about [Garbage Collection in the .Net Framework in version 2.0 and 3.0 a couple of years ago](/blog/2007/04/03/garbage-collection-flavors/ "Garbage Collection flavors in .Net 2.0 and 3.0"), but now Red Gate has created a simple and easy to understand funny comic &#8220;Memory Management in .Net&#8221;

[<img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-997" title="Memory Management in .Net comic" src="http://www.lybecker.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/MemoryManagementInDotNet.png" alt="Memory Management in .Net comic" width="550" height="239" />](http://www.red-gate.com/products/dotnet-development/ants-memory-profiler/learning-memory-management/resources/GCPoster.pdf)

[Download the full one-page comic](http://www.red-gate.com/products/dotnet-development/ants-memory-profiler/learning-memory-management/resources/GCPoster.pdf "Full Memory Management in .Net comic").

The .Net Framework 4.0 provides the new default behavior of [background garbage collection](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee787088.aspx#background_garbage_collection "Background Garbage Collection on MSDN").
