The answer is not 42 ðŸ™‚ , but 11.417. I will never be able to grasp the vast capabilities of the .Net Framework.

With more than 100.000 member itâ€™s no wonder that I am addicted [IntelliSense](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IntelliSense "Wikipedia on IntelliSense").

You can get more details on [Brad Abrams blog entry](http://blogs.msdn.com/brada/archive/2008/03/17/number-of-types-in-the-net-framework.aspx "Brad Abrams - Number of Types in the .NET Framework").
