The [Miracle SQL Server Open World](http://www.miracleas.dk/) conference was a great success. There were lots of informative sessions and great networking. I spoke to a lot of interesting people from all over the world including Microsoft SQL Server guys from Redmond and one as far away as from Brisbane, Australia. Bear in mind that this conference is held in the countryside, far away from anything, two hours drive from Copenhagen, Denmark.

I promised the attendances’ at my session &#8220;Transactions with Windows Communication Foundation&#8221; to post a guide to setup the Distributed Transaction Coordinator (DTC) for WCF. I have posted two guides:

  * [Configuring the DTC for WCF with OleTx](http://www.lybecker.com/blog/2007/03/12/configuring-the-dtc-for-wcf-with-oletx/)
  * [Configuring the DTC for WCF with WS-AtomicTransaction](http://www.lybecker.com/blog/2007/03/12/configuring-the-dtc-for-wcf-with-ws-atomictransaction/)

Hope to see all of these interesting people again at next year’s Miracle SQL Server Open World conference.
