I just got word from Microsoft, that I passed the Microsoft Certified Technology Specialist: .NET Framework 3.5, Windows Communication Foundation Applications certification (70-503).

It was not easy, as the preparation guide was incomplete and I didnâ€™t have time to properly prepare for the test. I took the beta exam in January, but had totally forgotten about it.

I am proud to be one of the first to pass this exam ðŸ™‚
