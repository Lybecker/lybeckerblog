Iâ€™m in Prague, Czech for the [Apache Lucene EuroCon 2010](http://www.lucene-eurocon.org/ "Conference website"); wandered around, where I saw this drawing on a house wall.

I find it hilarious â€“ especially the natural shadow over the coffins. Itâ€™s just by pure coincidence that I was there, at the time of day where the doorway cast its shadow over the coffins ðŸ™‚
