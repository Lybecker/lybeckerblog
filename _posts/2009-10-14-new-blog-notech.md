A talented colleague of mine Thomas Schou-Moldt has started blogging about software development processes and methods. He is passionate about the subject and writes well.

The blog is in Danish and called [NoTech](http://it-notech.blogspot.com/ "Thomas Schou-Moldt's blog - NoTech").

Blog description:

> Here I&#8217;ll share my opinions, joys and frustrations about software development and IT projects &#8211; both the good stories and horrendous experiences.
