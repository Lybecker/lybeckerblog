    Recently when I was flying back to Europe from South Africa with Lufthansa on <a title="Airbus A340-600 homepage" href="http://www.airbus.com/en/aircraftfamilies/a330a340/a340-600/">Airbus A340-600</a> the In-flight entertainment crashed just before takeoff. They had to restart the entire system. I could see the entire reload of the system including the initial download with 115K baud <a title="Wikipedia - XModem" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XMODEM">XModem protocol</a> download.

    Yikes! I hope that only non-vital systems are running Windows for an airliner. ðŸ™‚
