Recently when I was flying back to Europe from South Africa with Lufthansa on [Airbus A340-600](http://www.airbus.com/en/aircraftfamilies/a330a340/a340-600/) the In-flight entertainment crashed just before takeoff. They had to restart the entire system. I could see the entire reload of the system including the initial download with 115K baud [XModem protocol](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XMODEM)" download.

Yikes! I hope that only non-vital systems are running Windows for an airliner. ðŸ™‚
