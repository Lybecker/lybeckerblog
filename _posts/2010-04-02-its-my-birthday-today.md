Yep – It’s true, I’m one year older today.

The American singer and songwriter [Marvin Gaye](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvin_Gaye "Wikipedia - Marvin Gaye") and [Hans Christian Andersen](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Christian_Andersen "Wikipedia - Hans Christian Andersen") – the world famous Danish author and poet noted for his children’s fairy tale stories like &#8220;[The Ugly Duckling](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ugly_Duckling "Wikipedia - Fairy Tale The Ugly Duckling")&#8221; and &#8220;[The Little Mermaid](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Little_Mermaid "Wikipedia - Fairy Tale The Little Mermaid")&#8221; – both where born April 2<sup>nd</sup>.

This is also the day, The Falklands War started where Argentina invades the British Falkland Islands in 1982.

You can read more about [April 2<sup>nd</sup> on Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/April_2 "Information about April 2nd on Wikipedia").

Now I’m already 33 years old :-S
