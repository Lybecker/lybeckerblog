Or lack of üôÅ

My current project requires SSIS (SQL Server 2008 Integration Services) packages for [ETL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extract,_transform,_load "ETL at Wikipedia") processing.

SSIS seems very capable, but lacks fundamental things that a developer like me takes for granted. I did not expect SSIS to have the ability of inheritance as it isn‚Äôt object-oriented, but I did expect functions or methods like a procedural language or set-based languages like T-SQL. Sadly the answer is no.

You can make script tasks or script component with custom T-SQL or .Net code, but logic in expressions you have to duplicate.

I goggled reuse and SSIS and found this statement in an [article about reuse in SSIS](http://www.sqlservercentral.com/articles/SQL+Server+2005+-+SSIS/ssiscodereuseandcomplexcontrolflows/2021/ "Articel  	 SSIS - Code Reuse and Complex Control Flows") at SqlServerCentral.com:

> Let&#8217;s not forget, copy&paste _is_ the first level of code reuse

In essence it‚Äôs true, but I would hope the entire Information Technology industry has move way beyond this point years ago.
