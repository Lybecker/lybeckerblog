I am on the train to Copenhagen after a successful presentation of Solr/Lucene at the [Aarhus .NET user group](http://www.anug.dk/ "AArhus .NET user group homepage").

The presentation went very well judging by the number of questions during the almost 2Â½ hour long presentation and the feedback afterwards. Love it â€“ thanks ðŸ™‚

The presentation and code samples can be downloaded below:

* Presentation ([pdf](/wp-content/uploads/Apache-Lucene-ANUG.pdf) or [pptx](/wp-content/uploads/Apache-Lucene-ANUG.pptx))
* [Code samples (Visual Studio 2010)](/wp-content/uploads/AnugLucenePlayground.zip)

Please do contact me if you have any further questions â€“ Iâ€™ll love to help out.
