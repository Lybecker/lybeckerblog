Microsoft has released a poster for download, where you can see all the [system views for SQL Server 2008](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=531c53e7-8a2a-4375-8f2f-5d799aa67b5c&displaylang=en) and the relationships between them.

Microsoft also released the [system views poster for SQL Server 2005](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=2EC9E842-40BE-4321-9B56-92FD3860FB32&displaylang=en) a couple of years ago.

You need a huge printer/plotter to print these&#8230;
