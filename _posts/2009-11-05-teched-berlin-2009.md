Are you going?

I havenâ€™t taken the time to browse through the session catalogs yet, but I will be seeking information about:

  * Microsoft&#8217;s acquisition of FAST Search and how Microsoft incorporates into their products
  * Microsoft SQL Server 2008 R2 and especially the spatial support for Reporting Services
  * The new features of Windows Communication Foundation 4.0, the redesigned Windows Workflow Foundation 4.0 and .Net 4.0 in general.
  * The Windows Azure Platform
  * ASP.Net MVC 2

If you are going, drop me a mail and Iâ€™ll buy you a beer. Thatâ€™s the least I can do for my readers ðŸ™‚
