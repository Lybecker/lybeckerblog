Iâ€™m going to TechEd conference in Berlin next week. Are you going?

I havenâ€™t taken the time to browse through the session catalogs yet, but I will be seeking information about:

* Microsoft's acquisition of FAST Search and how Microsoft incorporates into their products
* Microsoft SQL Server 2008 R2 and especially the spatial support for Reporting Services
* The new features of Windows Communication Foundation 4.0, the redesigned Windows Workflow Foundation 4.0 and .Net 4.0 in general.
* The Windows Azure Platform
* ASP.Net MVC 2

If you are going, drop me a mail and Iâ€™ll buy you a beer. Thatâ€™s the least I can do for my readers ðŸ™‚
