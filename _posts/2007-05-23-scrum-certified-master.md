Yesterday I returned from Milan, Italy, after completing a great Scrum Master Certification course taught by the experienced Scrum trainer [Joseph Pelrine](http://www.metaprog.com/blogs/).

[Scrum](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_%28management%29) is an agile project management method for managing projects with continuously changing requirements
and/or complex social and technical domains.

Joseph brought his friend Tim Mackinnon, whom is also a Scrum master and the originator of [mock objects](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mock_object). I really enjoyed the course and learned a lot. We had some enlightening discussions during the course and social engagements in the evenings.

I highly recommend this course and the teachings of Joseph Pelrine to all whom looking to improve their ability to delivery quality solutions.
